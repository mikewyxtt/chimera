Directory structure explained
-------------------------------------

PC's have two types of firmware, legacy BIOS and UEFI. The loader code is the same for both types of firmware, with the low level mechanics of the firmware abstracted behind a library.

bios: 
BIOS specific code. Contains loader libraries, a boot manager (master boot record) and a "preloader" which resides in the first 2 sectors of the primary partition.
The preloader exists soley to establish a protected mode environment and load "loader" into memory.

uefi:
UEFI specific code. Contains loader libraries and startup code to initialize environment

loader:
Basic bootloader. Finds and loads booster, kernel the servers
